Hi! My name is Andreas and I am A PhD Candidate at the Department of Mechanical Engineering at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/). I am advised by Professor [MS. Triantafyllou](https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/MISTETRI@MIT.EDU) at the [MIT Tow Tank](https://web.mit.edu/towtank) and Professor [T. Sapsis](https://sandlab.mit.edu/?page_id=6) at the [Stochastic Analysis and Nonlinear Dynamics Lab](https://sandlab.mit.edu/). Born and raised in [Athens, Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens), surrounded by the Mediterranean sea I naturally developed a deep connection with marine environments and sea creatures!

At MIT, I am conducting interdisciplinary research on fluid-structure interaction phenomena leveraging machine learning techniques. On the one hand, I am developing a digital twin for marine risers, which are long flexible underwater pipelines vibrating constantly under the excitation of hydrodynamic loads. I am developing software to continuously reconstruct and forecast the (nonstationary) spatio-temporal vortex-induced vibrations (2D time-series) using transformers and other deep net architectures. On the other hand, I am writting generative modelling codes to generate both synthetic time-series of vortex-induced vibrations as well as ocean seascapes of marine animals using data collected within New England and the Gulf of Maine.

My academic journey began in 2016 when I joined the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) as an undergraduate student. By 2020, I graduated summa cum laude with two bachelor's degrees, one in [Mechanical Engineering](https://me.engin.umich.edu/) and the second in [Naval Architecture & Marine Eningeering](https://name.engin.umich.edu/) with a minor in Mathematics. My undergraduate research was on marine renewable energy harvesting at the [MRELab](https://websites.umich.edu/~mrel/) under the mentorship of Professor [MM. Bernitsas](https://name.engin.umich.edu/people/bernitsas-michael/). In 2020, I joined [MIT's MechE Department](https://meche.mit.edu/) where I have completed an SM (2022). Having spent over 7 years in academic programs, I have developed a strong background in mathematical modelling, numerical methods, statistics, algorithms, machine learning, optimization, and programming through coursework, research, and internships. 

Besides academics, I am an avid musician and have been a violinist for the [MIT Symphony Orchestra](https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/mit-symphony-orchestra) for the past four years. I also enjoy riding motorcycles and I am probably the only red motorcycle riding around Cambridge/Boston in the dead winter cold in search of breweries and concerts (checkout @ath_bikelife_expat on instagram).
