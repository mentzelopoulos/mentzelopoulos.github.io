Hi! My name is Andreas and I am a PhD Candidate at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/) advised by Professor [Michael S. Triantafyllou](https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/MISTETRI@MIT.EDU) and Professor [Themis Sapsis](https://sandlab.mit.edu/?page_id=6).  My primary research interests lie in **deep learning**, **time series forecasting**, and **generative modeling** with applications to engineering and finance.

I am leveraging **deep learning** techniques to develop a [digital twin](https://onepetro.org/OTCONF/proceedings-abstract/24OTC/4-24OTC/545009) for risers -- long, flexible underwater pipelines -- vibrating constantly under the excitation of stochastic hydrodynamic loads. Driven by [vortex-induced vibrations (VIV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex-induced_vibration), the dynamics are **nonlinear, nonstationary,** and exhibit strong **memory** effects. In order to address those challenges, I am using [transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) to model and **continuously forecast** the vibrations in real time.

I am also leveraging **generative models** to synthesize instances of multivariate VIV time-series since experiments can be not only logistically challenging but also financially prohibitive. My approach includes using [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network), especially [Wasserstein GANs (wGANs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875), [Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114), and [Denoising-Diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239). My results indicate that generated data retain much of the intrinsic properties of the original data, and that forecasting models trained on synthetic data can accurately predict real spatio-temporal VIV.

My work in **generative modeling** also includes **LOBSTgER** (Learning Oceanic Bioecological Systems Through Generative Representations): an effort dedicated to generating ultra-realistic high-resolution underwater imagery to raise awareness of the marine habitats in Massachusetts and the Gulf of Maine. This effort is run in collaboration with renowned photographer [Keith Ellenbogen](https://www.keithellenbogen.com/). Using Keith's exemplary images as training data I have been able to train a [latent diffusion model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752) to generate detailed images of species such as Lion's Mane Jellyfish, Mola Mola, and others. We are currently advancing this work and plan to publicize it through exhibitions and articles in the near future.

As far as leveraging **deep learning** for **financial applications**, I have developed market neutral **statistical arbitrage** trading stategies for public equities using deep neural network architectures which have been back-tested in the US', Hong-Kong's, and China's stock markets (work done as part of Wall Street internship).


I was born and raised in [Athens, Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) where I developed a passion for engineering, the marine environments, and music. My academic journey began at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) where I graduated summa cum laude with two bachelor's degrees, one in [Mechanical Engineering](https://me.engin.umich.edu/) and the second in [Naval Architecture & Marine Engineering](https://name.engin.umich.edu/) with a minor in Mathematics. My undergraduate research was on marine renewable energy harvesting at the [MRELab](https://websites.umich.edu/~mrel/) under the mentorship of Professor [M.M. Bernitsas](https://name.engin.umich.edu/people/bernitsas-michael/). I joined [MIT's MechE Department](https://meche.mit.edu/) as a graduate student where I have completed an SM (2022). During my academic training, I have developed a strong background in mathematical modeling, numerical methods, statistics, algorithms, machine learning, optimization, and programming through coursework, research, and internships.

Academics aside, I am a violinist for the [MIT Symphony Orchestra](https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/mit-symphony-orchestra) and enjoy hanging out with friends, attending concerts, and musical theater shows.
